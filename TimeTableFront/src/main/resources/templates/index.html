                        Our software is designed for institutions. Our aim was to create a personalised timetable, where you can store and view student, teacher, classroom, class roster, timetable, etc.
                        Institutions (schools) can store students' and teachers' data electronically.
                        The door number of the classrooms will also be registered and their seating capacity can be viewed in the application.
                        The list of classes and the names of the students in them are available in our application.
                        You can also view the subjects of the teachers.
                        And what the app was designed for was the timetable, which the user can view by class, broken down by day.
